360 Degree Perspective/Cheatbreaker F5 Mod for modern Minecraft

## 1.8.9 backport???
Some friends and I were dissatisfied with existing perspective mods for 1.8.9, so I decided to backport 1.14+ versions.

I may eventually also backport to Legacy Fabric versions if and when 1.8.9 is in a usable state.
